# odin-recipes

recipes html exercices for the odin project personal evaluation.

The exercices went well. I think doing all the assignment and the additional
 stuff really help making this exercise fairly easy.

The thing i really liked was that it was a bigger project and there little
 handhelding but i had to figure on my own a couple of stuff.

I can't wait to continue this curriculum.
